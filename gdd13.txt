What do I need to learn?
    Making a procedurally-generated heightmap, and converting it into a map
    Generating random scenery

Workflow
    Build player scene and movement
    Program the heightmap functionality
    Randomly generate water table to form ponds and lakes
    Set terrain to randomize on load (just randomize the seed value)
    Put the heightmap on the player map
    Build the player's compass, pointing to a point faaaar off the map
    Attach map, compass to player and tween 'em
    Fix initialize so player starts on the ground
    Fix E-W map flip
    Make goal circle in Krita
    Randomly generate a goal, and trigger scene end on enter
    Align goal circle to goal on map
    Fix player-goal interaction
    "Unshade" map
    Make map into an island
    Tune terrain so player can go pretty much anywhere
    Get tree, rock models
    Clamp player movement to map

    Build title and end scenes (slowly circle a randomly-generated scene)
    Implement nature sounds - wind, birds, water, etc.
    Add sun
    Allow player to determine seed

    To do later:
    Make goal and player spawn points flat
    Randomly generate trees, rocks and place around area
    Implement music sparingly - like in Breath of the Wild?
